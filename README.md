# CS221 Final Project
Currently we have 2 files:
GameUtil.py: code controlling gameboard ('Board') and tiles ('Tile')
Game.py: code with problem model ('Game'), a baseline agent ('BaselineAgent'), and some stuff to run the game easily ('PlayGame')
You should be able to see/play stuff just by importing game.py in python terminal
